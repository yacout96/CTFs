#Steps


-Used https://codewithrockstar.com/online to try run this rockstar code			//Added output numbers in output.tx
-cat output.txt | tr '\r\n' ' ' > output2.txt						//format as one line containing all numbers
-Used a script I wrote to convert bases (Can be found /PicoCTF-Writups/convertBases.py) //rrrocknrn0113r
											//picoCTF{rrrocknrn0113r}
